DefaultScriptMaker
==================

Creates default object setup scripts based off of iffs in a folder

Before the program can generate the scripts, you must define where the iff's are located at inside "config.cfg". You must then provide
an export folder (EF) in the same configuration file, unless you want a flood of files in your working directory. Note that
the export folder must be created already, otherwise it won't do anything.

The program simply requires you to run "DefaultScriptMaker.jar" after you have configured the settings.

Happy scripting!
